# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow
Use efficient git commands with conventional commits:
```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat: did some thing" && git push origin main
```

## Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep to one line only
- No additional notes or co-author tags
